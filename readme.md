# Do well to read this instruction to better understand how to use the background image property in CSS
++
# Create a folder in any directory from your PC and then open it with vsCode
# Create a folder ~images~ that will contain the images for your project
# link your css to your html file
# use the background property in your css and then make sure you correctly access the directory where the image is stored.

I guess this should most probably guide you through and as well as sort out any issue you may have regarding the background image property.

Thank you!!!
